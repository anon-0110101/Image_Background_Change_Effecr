# Image_Background_Change_Effect 

This project is a simple web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to showcase the visual impact of a photo with and without a background. It allows users to toggle between two views, offering a unique perspective on images.

Project Overview
HTML: The HTML structure provides the layout for the web page and includes an image display area, and toggle button.

CSS: CSS stylesheets were used to design the user interface and control the appearance of the image display area.

How to Use
Open the index.html file in your web browser.
Use the toggle buttons to switch between the following views:

Image without Background: This view showcases the image with its background removed, giving it a transparent look.
